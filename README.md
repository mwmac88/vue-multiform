# Vue Multi Step Form with Vuetify

Latest build: https://priceless-goldwasser-b8eb95.netlify.com/

NOTE: Form does not successfully send to API due to endpoint failing to register Javascript Boolean values for 'live_in_uk' field. To solve, minor amendment to API will be required to redifine accepted data type.

## MVP - TO DO

* Loading states & UI Feedback on form complete axios request
* Jest Unit tests
* Nightwatch E2E tests

## V1.0

* JSON Data for all inputs (GraphQL)
* Seperate components and use slots (Steps & Dialog)
* Add JSDoc comments to key functions
